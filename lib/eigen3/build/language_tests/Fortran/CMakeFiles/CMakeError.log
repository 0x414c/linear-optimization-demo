Use:
devenv  [solutionfile | projectfile | anyfile.ext]  [switches]

The first argument for devenv is usually a solution file or project file.
You can also use any other file as the first argument if you want to have the
file open automatically in an editor. When you enter a project file, the IDE
looks for an .sln file with the same base name as the project file in the
parent directory for the project file. If no such .sln file exists, then the
IDE looks for a single .sln file that references the project. If no such single
.sln file exists, then the IDE creates an unsaved solution with a default .sln
file name that has the same base name as the project file.

Command line builds:
devenv solutionfile.sln /build [ solutionconfig ] [ /project projectnameorfile [ /projectconfig name ] ]
Available command line switches:

/Build		Builds the solution or project with the specified solution
		configuration. For example "Debug". If multiple platforms
		are possible, the configuration name must be enclosed in quotes
		and contain platform name. For example: "Debug|Win32".
/Clean		Deletes build outputs.
/Command	Starts the IDE and executes the command.
/Deploy		Builds and then deploys the specified build configuration.
/Edit		Opens the specified files in a running instance of this
		application. If there are no running instances, it will
		start a new instance with a simplified window layout.
/LCID		Sets the default language in the IDE for the UI.
/Log		Logs IDE activity to the specified file for troubleshooting.
/NoVSIP		Disables the VSIP developer's license key for VSIP testing.
/Out		Appends the build log to a specified file.
/Project	Specifies the project to build, clean, or deploy.
		Must be used with /Build, /Rebuild, /Clean, or /Deploy.
/ProjectConfig	Overrides the project configuration specified in the solution
		configuration. For example "Debug". If multiple platforms are
		possible, the configuration name must be enclosed in quotes
		and contain platform name. For example: "Debug|Win32".
		Must be used with /Project.
/Rebuild	Cleans and then builds the solution or project with the
		specified configuration.
